        "description": "Aloe vera, commonly grown as a houseplant, is known for its leaves which contain a soothing gel used on sunburns and other skin irritations. With over 300 species (the most common being Aloe barbadensis miller), this tropical succulent features fleshy lance-shape leaves with jagged edges that grow out from a basal rosette. Given the right growing conditions, spiky flowers will appear on the end of stalks in shades of yellow, red, or orange. Consuming the leaves is toxic for people.1 The leaves are also toxic to dogs and cats.",
